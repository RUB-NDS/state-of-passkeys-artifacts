Target also provides loyalty and credit card services to its customers.\n\n\n\nThe Challenge/ Use Case\n\n\n\nThe initial use case for FIDO at Target was to help enable a secure login experience across applications at the company, as part of a broader platform modernization effort.\n\n\n\nTarget's challenge was to provide a consistent and secure login experience across applications at Target, to provide a seamless experience to its users. \n\n\n\n\"We had to reduce friction, wherever possible, be it in the authentication flow by reducing the dependencies on passwords, or in the onboarding process by making it easier for applications and business owners to easily consume the enterprise authentication services,\" explained Nataraj Rao, Principal Engineer for Security Solutions at Target.\n\n\n\nHow Target Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users\n\n\n\nTarget initially integrated a FIDO server with its Single Sign On (SSO) platform to provide multi-factor strong authentication capabilities.\n\n\n\n\"Support for a wide variety of authenticators makes it possible for team members to choose from a wide variety of authenticators and avoids a scenario where they are not able to move forward, just because they did not have a specific authenticator at that time,\" Rao said.\n\n\n\nWith a solid understanding of how FIDO works and how it can be integrated with Target's systems there are multiple use cases where it can be deployed. Among those use cases is for providing additional verification, in a multi factor authentication flow. FIDO can be used as the primary authenticator and can completely eliminate passwords from the login equation. It can be used for native authentication to mobile applications, providing a very intuitive login experience for Target's mobile users.\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\nFIDO2 in particular has been useful for Target as it's integrated into most modern web browsers without the need for users to install any",

Target also provides loyalty and credit card services to its customers.\n\n\n\nThe Challenge/ Use Case\n\n\n\nThe initial use case for FIDO at Target was to help enable a secure login experience across applications at the company, as part of a broader platform modernization effort.\n\n\n\nTarget's challenge was to provide a consistent and secure login experience across applications at Target, to provide a seamless experience to its users. \n\n\n\n\"We had to reduce friction, wherever possible, be it in the authentication flow by reducing the dependencies on passwords, or in the onboarding process by making it easier for applications and business owners to easily consume the enterprise authentication services,\" explained Nataraj Rao, Principal Engineer for Security Solutions at Target.\n\n\n\nHow Target Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users\n\n\n\nTarget initially integrated a FIDO server with its Single Sign On (SSO) platform to provide multi-factor strong authentication capabilities.\n\n\n\n\"Support for a wide variety of authenticators makes it possible for team members to choose from a wide variety of authenticators and avoids a scenario where they are not able to move forward, just because they did not have a specific authenticator at that time,\" Rao said.\n\n\n\nWith a solid understanding of how FIDO works and how it can be integrated with Target's systems there are multiple use cases where it can be deployed. Among those use cases is for providing additional verification, in a multi factor authentication flow. FIDO can be used as the primary authenticator and can completely eliminate passwords from the login equation. It can be used for native authentication to mobile applications, providing a very intuitive login experience for Target's mobile users.\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\nFIDO2 in particular has been useful for Target as it's integrated into most modern web browsers without the need for users to install any",

Making the login experience more seamless also helps to improve the overall user experience as well.\n\n\n\n\"We chose FIDO because the standards are open, and allow for simpler and stronger authentication that is based on public key cryptography,\" Kurian said. \"In other words, it's easy to use and more secure, at the same time.\"",

Gemini enables its users to transact both via a website as well as mobile apps to buy, sell and store cryptocurrency assets.\n\n\n\nThe Challenge/ Use Case\n\n\n\nAs a financial services vendor in a space that is highly targeted by criminals, the need for strong authentication is paramount. \n\n\n\nGemini's security efforts are led by Chief Security Officer Dave Damato who is no stranger to the security industry and previously worked at security incident response firm Mandiant.\n\n\n\n\"So much of my career has been really focused on preventing and responding to incidents and strong two factor authentication is at the core preventing most of those attacks,\" Damato said (in a session at the Authenticate Financial Services Summit). \"It's also why I'm so very enthusiastic about FIDO.\"\n\n\n\nHow Gemini Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users\n\n\n\nGemini wanted to provide its users with the strongest level of security authentication to help minimize risk.\n\n\n\nWhile using an SMS based two factor approach can be better than just a username and password, given the high value of a Gemini account, attackers might well go through the steps necessary to bypass SMS two factor. Beginning in 2019, Gemini began offering its customers the highest level of security possible and it did this by starting to support the FIDO2 authentication standard.\n\n\n\n\"FIDO2 is designed to overcome challenges and dramatically increase the cost for an attacker,\" Damato said. \"There's no password that can be shared by our customers and that's why FIDO2 is phishing resistant.\"\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\nFor Gemini, the use of FIDO2 provides a series of tangible risk mitigation benefits that helps to reduce the attack surface. Instead of needing to rely on a One-Time Password (OTP), SMS or backup codes, Gemini users can benefit from a more user-friendly FIDO2 powered experience.\n\n\n\nAmong the most common types of attack is credential stuffing, where an",

Gemini enables its users to transact both via a website as well as mobile apps to buy, sell and store cryptocurrency assets.\n\n\n\nThe Challenge/ Use Case\n\n\n\nAs a financial services vendor in a space that is highly targeted by criminals, the need for strong authentication is paramount. \n\n\n\nGemini's security efforts are led by Chief Security Officer Dave Damato who is no stranger to the security industry and previously worked at security incident response firm Mandiant.\n\n\n\n\"So much of my career has been really focused on preventing and responding to incidents and strong two factor authentication is at the core preventing most of those attacks,\" Damato said (in a session at the Authenticate Financial Services Summit). \"It's also why I'm so very enthusiastic about FIDO.\"\n\n\n\nHow Gemini Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users\n\n\n\nGemini wanted to provide its users with the strongest level of security authentication to help minimize risk.\n\n\n\nWhile using an SMS based two factor approach can be better than just a username and password, given the high value of a Gemini account, attackers might well go through the steps necessary to bypass SMS two factor. Beginning in 2019, Gemini began offering its customers the highest level of security possible and it did this by starting to support the FIDO2 authentication standard.\n\n\n\n\"FIDO2 is designed to overcome challenges and dramatically increase the cost for an attacker,\" Damato said. \"There's no password that can be shared by our customers and that's why FIDO2 is phishing resistant.\"\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\nFor Gemini, the use of FIDO2 provides a series of tangible risk mitigation benefits that helps to reduce the attack surface. Instead of needing to rely on a One-Time Password (OTP), SMS or backup codes, Gemini users can benefit from a more user-friendly FIDO2 powered experience.\n\n\n\nAmong the most common types of attack is credential stuffing, where an",
